# GitOps with FluxCD and Tanzu Packages

This repo can be used to deploy Tanzu Packages in a GitOps fashion.

Please note: Packages in this repository are pre-configured with example values for custom virtual hosts (ingress), storage class, passwords, syslog target, etc… you have to change the configuration according to your environment first! 

The current process to update the values is: 
1. Modify package values as desired under `data-values` folder
2. Encode the entire values file in base64 ie. On linux execute: `cat ./data-values/harbor-data-values.yaml | base64`
3. Copy the output and update the data key in `<packagename>/<packagename>-data-values-secret.yaml`

The [FluxCD Kustomization manifests](https://github.com/coreydinkens/tmc-flux-poc/tree/master/flux-config) have the following dependencies configured:
1. **pre-reqs folder** - Installs service accounts needed to manage Tanzu Carvel packages
2. **flux-config folder** - Installs all Tanzu packages
  a. pre-reqs
    1. cert-manager
    2. fluent-bit
    3. contour  
      a. Harbor
      b. Prometheus
        1. Grafana

Once Flux has been successfully enabled, add kustomizations in the following order to avoid package install/removal issues with prune enabled:
1. Add pre-reqs folder Flux kustomization
2. Add flux-config folder Flux kustomization

It is important to note this repo is not what I would consider 'production' ready due to the current package installer service account config. Next iteration is to move each SA to it's own namespace to match existing Carvel methodology

Please note: This repository has been tested with TKGs (vSphere with Tanzu – 7U3).

# GitOps with FluxCD and Helm Packages
Use these two directories to test Helm deployments with Flux:
1. kube-prometheus-stack-helm - Self contained Prometheus + Grafana monitoring stack
2. wordpress-helm - Bitnami Wordpress site + MariaDB deployment

Please be aware, that this repository is not officially verified, tested or supported by VMware!
